    "\n",
    "Where Confidence intervals allow us to estimate a population parameter, the process of **hypothesis testing** allows us to make a _decision_ about a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will conduct hypothesis tests on **single means** and **single proportions**. You will also learn about the **errors** associated with these tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing consists of two contradictory hypotheses or statements, a decision based on the data, and a conclusion. To perform a hypothesis test, a statistician will:\n",
    "1. Set up two contradictory hypotheses.\n",
    "2. Collect sample data (in homework problems, the data or summary statistics will be given to you).\n",
    "3. Determine the correct distribution to perform the hypothesis test.\n",
    "4. Analyze sample data by performing the calculations that ultimately will allow you to reject or decline to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "5. Make a decision and write a meaningful conclusion."

    "## Null and Alternative Hypotheses\n",
    "The actual test begins by considering two **hypotheses**.  They are called the **null hypothesis** and the **alternative hypothesis**.  These hypotheses contain opposing viewpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_0$: **The null hypothesis**: It is a statement of no difference between the variables—they are not related. This can often be considered the _status quo_ and as a result if you cannot accept the null it requires some action.\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_a$: **The alternative hypothesis**: It is a claim about the population that is contradictory to $H_0$ and what we conclude when we reject $H_0$. <span style=\"color:yellow\">This is usually what the researcher is trying to prove.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the null and alternative hypotheses are contradictory, you must examine evidence to decide if you have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not. The evidence is in the form of sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have determined which hypothesis the sample supports, you make a **decision**. There are two options for a decision. They are:\n",
    "* \"reject $H_O$\" if the sample information favors the alternative hypothesis\n",
    "* \"do not reject $H_O$\" or \"decline to reject $H_O$\" if the sample information is insufficient to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",

    "|less than or equal to ($\\leq$)|more than ($\\gt$)|\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: H0 always has a symbol with an equal in it. Ha never has a symbol with an equal in it. The choice of symbol depends on the wording of the hypothesis test. However, be aware that many researchers (including one of the co-authors in research work) use = in the null hypothesis, even with > or < as the symbol in the alternative hypothesis. This practice is acceptable because we only make the decision to reject or not reject the null hypothesis."
